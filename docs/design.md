I see, I misunderstood the initial context. You're correct, in the case of a password manager, passwords must indeed be stored in a manner that allows for their secure retrieval.

You can use SQLite in combination with an encryption algorithm to achieve this. One such approach would be to use a database encryption extension like SQLCipher. With SQLCipher, the entire SQLite database is encrypted, and data stored in it can only be accessed by applications or users who have the correct key.

However, here are some additional considerations to ensure secure storage and retrieval of passwords in a password manager:

Master Password: In a password manager, a single master password is usually used as the key to unlock the rest of the stored passwords. This master password should be known only to the user and not stored anywhere.

Key Derivation Function (KDF): To enhance security, this master password is generally put through a key derivation function such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 to generate the encryption key. The process includes a salt and many iterations to make brute-force attacks as difficult as possible.

Encryption Algorithm: Once you have an encryption key, you can use it to encrypt and decrypt the data you store. Strong symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are typically used. The key derived from the master password is used to encrypt and decrypt the passwords stored in the password manager.

Secure Password Retrieval: When a password is requested, the password manager should decrypt it using the key derived from the master password and deliver it to the requesting party, often by placing it on the system clipboard for a short period of time. The decrypted password should never be stored longer than necessary.

Secure Design: The entire design of the password manager should be secure. This includes things like automatically locking the password database after a period of inactivity, clearing sensitive data from memory as soon as possible, and more.

Secure Coding Practices: As with any software, especially security-critical ones, it's essential to follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the data.

Remember, creating a secure password manager is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of encryption and security practices. Be sure to consult with a security expert or conduct a thorough security audit before releasing any such application.
